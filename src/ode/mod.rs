//! Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solvers.
//!
//! This module provides a set of adaptive and non-adaptive ODE solvers.
//! All use Runga-Kutta methods to solve the ODEs.
//!
//! Solvers are adapted from Julia's DifferentialEquations.jl package.
//!
//! Solvers use coefficients from Jim Verner's website:
//! <https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/
//! which is awesome
//!
//! For certain solvers, interpolation between the starting and ending
//! points is enabled via separate interpolation functions.
