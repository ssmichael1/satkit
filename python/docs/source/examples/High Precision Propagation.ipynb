    "# High-Precision Propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates high-precision orbit propagation using satkit's advanced numerical integration capabilities. It propagates a GPS satellite orbit over a 24-hour period and validates the results against high-fidelity SP3 ephemeris data from the European Space Agency (ESA).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The example performs the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Loads Reference Data**: Reads GPS satellite positions from an SP3 file containing precise orbit determination results (note: velocity is not included)\n",
    "2. **Rotate to Inertial Frame**: Rotate the GPS satellite positions from the ITRF (Earth-fixed) to the GCRF (inertial) frame\n",
    "3. **Fits Initial Conditions**: Use the high-precision propagator to output the state and state transition matrix at the SP3 timestamps. Use that matrix to linearize the system and solve for corrections to the initial state (position and velocity) that minimize errors over the 1-day data set.\n",
    "The least-squares fit minimizes: $$||p_{gps}(t) - \\hat{p}(t; s_0) - \\Phi_p(t; s_0) \\, \\Delta s_0||^2$$\n",
    "where $p_{gps}(t)$ is the SP3 position in GCRF, $\\hat{p}(t; s_0)$ is the propagated position from initial state $s_0$, $\\Phi_p(t; s_0)$ is the position block of the state transition matrix, and $\\Delta s_0$ is the correction to the initial state, which is what we are solving for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: We wrap a bounded, non-linear solve for solar radiation pressure ($CrA/m$) around the least-squares fit to improve accuracy. This adds complexity but highlights the precision achievable with the high-fidelity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Validates Results**: Compares the propagated positions against the SP3 truth data and visualizes the position errors\n",
    "\n",
    "This example showcases satkit's ability to achieve meter-level accuracy over extended propagation periods when properly configured with high-fidelity force models and optimized initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SP3 file contains a full 24 hours of satellite positions, recorded once every 5 minutes"
