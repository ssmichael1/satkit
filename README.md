## Language Bindings

- **Native Rust** bindings
- **Python bindings** for compiled rust code ... speed of Rust with convenience of Python<br/>
  Install with `pip install satkit`<br/>
  PyPi includes binary packages for windows, macos (Intel & ARM), and linux.  Python documentation is at: <https://satellite-toolkit.readthedocs.io/latest/>

## Features

- High-precision coordinate transforms between:
  - International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF)
  - Geocentric Celestial Reference Frame (GCRF) using IAU-2000 reduction
  - True-Equinox Mean Equator (TEME) frame used in SGP4 propagation of TLEs
  - Celestial Intermediate Reference Frame (CIRF)
  - Terrestrial Intermediate Reference Frame (TIRF)
  - Terrestrial Geodetic frame (latitude, longitude)
- Geodesic distances
- SGP4, and Keplerian orbit propagation
- JPL high-precision planetary ephemerides
- High-order gravity models
- High-precision, high-speed numerical satellite orbit propagation with high-order efficient Runga-Kutta solvers, ability to solve for state transition matrix, and inclusion following forces:
  - High-order Earth gravity with multiple models
  - Solar gravity
  - Lunar gravity
  - Drag: NRL MISE-00 density model
  - Radiation pressure

## ODE Solvers

The high-precision numerical satellite orbit propagation makes use of adaptive Runga-Kutta methods for integration of ordinary differential equations. The pure-Rust ODE solver is included as part of the library.

The methods use Runga-Kutta pairs for ODE integration and error estimation generated by Jim Verner: [https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/](https://www.sfu.ca/~jverner/)

## Verification

The package includes rust test modules and python test modules for verification of nearly all calculations, including but not limited to:

- **JPL Ephemeris** - Via JPL-provided test vectors for Chebychev polynomial calculation
- **SGP4** - Via SGP4 test vectors provided with original C<sup>++</sup> distribution

## Getting Started

### Rust

Simply include the code in your Cargo.toml file to use.  Once installed, make sure you run `utils.update_datafiles` to download the most-recent [data files](#data-dependencies) necessary for many calculations.  This only needs to be done once, unless more-recent space weather and Earth orientation parameter data is required (these are updated at least daily).

```rust
satkit.utils.update_datafiles()?;
```


### Python

Satkit is available via pypi.org, and can be installed via the `pip` command:
```bash
python -m pip install satkit
```

Binaries are available for Windows (AMD64), Mac (Intel, Apple Silicon) and Linux (x86_64, aarch64) for python versions 3.8 through 3.13.

Once installed, make sure you download the most-recent [data files](#data-dependencies) necessary for many calculations.  This only needs to be done once, unless more-recent space weather and Earth orientation parameter data is required (these are updated at least daily).
```python
import satkit as sk
sk.utils.update_datafiles()
```
